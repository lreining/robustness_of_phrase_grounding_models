# Robustness of State-of-the-Art Visual Grounding Models using Corrupted Linguistic Dependency Structures

## Model Setups
### GLIP
We used the models provided on the following github page: [https://github.com/microsoft/GLIP]. Specifically we used GLIP-T (C), GLIP-T and GLIP-L.

To test the models, complete the following steps:
0. If you haven't downloaded the models yet run the run_models.sh file
1. To start the docker image run the run_docker.sh file. Adjust the mounts as needed
2. Within the docker image, run the run_models.sh file. Adjust the output directory
